## Welcome to the Pallet Theme!

Originally created by [the-turk](https://github.com/the-turk/flarum-pallet-theme), this theme offers a beautiful and dynamic user interface for your Flarum forum. With the original author unable to maintain it, I have taken over the development to ensure it remains compatible with the latest Flarum updates.
